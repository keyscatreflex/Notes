About a week ago I took a break from TOP and looked into FCC
I noticed how different the learning style was
theres pros and cons to both and really wish there was a curriculumn to take advantage of both
on one end TOP teaches conceptual learning with a broader idea of the material
on the other end, FCC is more piece by piece information while executing code with an emphasis on learning as you go
The two go about the learning process at completely different paces
What I noticed is though TOP focuses on having broad concepts in place before placing any lessons on code
the lessons it provides are essential for the path it takes
by the time it involves any code into its lessons, I had already learned how to set up a coding environment,
install git, rigister a github account, and picked up a bit of shell command.
The difference in depth that TOP covered is incomparible
FCC jumps strait to projects, and for me, it was just waht I needed as I had gotten bored of sitting in place just to keep reading
FCC has you start its curriculum by completing projects
It doesn't have you read more than a paragraph at a time as you practice the instruction on the screen.
theres no environment to set up, no git or github, just code at its most basic level.
as of the time of writing this entry, I have just completed 2 projects a free cat photo app as well as a cafe menu
at this point I am glad to hace been able to jumo from one curriculumto another.
Im ready to jump back on to TOP.
