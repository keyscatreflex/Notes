Selectors

Chaining Selectors can be done with tags, classes, and id(s)

Use as many classes as needed; theres no limit to number of classes used.
class=class another-class third-class final-class

how to make a declairation based on class:
.selector.selector.selector {
    property:value
}


example

index.html
<body>
    <div class=title header id=watermelon>
        <h1 class=title improvise>Watermelon</h1>
        <p> Hello World</p>
    </div>
</body>

index.css


.title{
    font-family:'Helvetica', sans-sarif
}

nesting tags
#watermelon p{
    the space between #watermelon
    and p refer to any p element
    nested within the watermelon 
    id
}

.title.improvise{
    this chain referes to 
    any number of classes to
    add specificity; in this case,
    <h1> is selected 
}
